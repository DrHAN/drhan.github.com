<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>

<p>My name is Bo Han (韩波), and you can call me Kevin. I am now a research assistant at underwater vehicle laboratory (UVL), headed by Professor Bo He, Ocean University of China. My research interests lie on the interface of machine learning, cognitive science and computer vision. Currently, I am working on two fantastic topics: 1) Sparse Representation and Dictionary Learning 2) Brain-Inspired Neural Networks.</p>
<pre><code>Education Background:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_University_of_China">Ocean University of China (OUC)</a>                             Sep.2011-Jun.2014
M.Phil. in Signal Processing. Overall GPA:84.26/100 Major GPA:86.2/100
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingdao_Agricultural_University">Qingdao Agricultural University (QAU)</a>                     Sep.2007-Jun.2011
B.Eng. in Communication Engineering. Overall GPA:83/100 Major GPA:86.5/100
</code></pre>
<p>I am applying to Ph.D. programs. I deeply appreciate the help and support from my professors, fellow students, and family members. By the way, many <B>"distinguished"</B> professors rejected my application proposal because of my bachelor degree. However, <a href="http://pmb.berkeley.edu/profile/sluan">Professor Sheng Luan (Berkeley)</a> is one of our distinguished alumni in QAU, so please do not judge a person only by his starting point.</p>

<h3><a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Research Experience</h3>
<pre><code>Sparse Representation and Dictionary Learning:
1 Ongoing: I am working on a topic related to robust face recognition via sparse
representation previously proposed by Prof. Yi Ma.

2 Oct.2013-Jan.2014: I expanded a project called Computational Models of Early 
Visual Cortex previously led by Dr.Shan (Gary's group, UCSD). The new model well 
mimic the functional roles of early visual layers like V1 or V2.

Brain-Inspired Learning Algorithms:
1 Ongoing: I am also working on a topic related to convolutional neural networks 
(CNN) previously proposed by Prof. Yann Lecun.

2 Jun.2012-June.2014: I finished a project called Ensemble Learning based on Extreme
Learning Machine which includes two new frameworks. The first one is the LARSEN-ELM 
employing the LARS algorithm. And the other is the RMSE-ELM based on recursive 
models.
</code></pre>
<p>Recently, I pay more efforts on sparse representation for fast face recognition via different regularization and bio-inspired feature extraction.</p>

<h3>Intern Experience</h3>
<pre><code>Alcate-Lucent, Qingdao, China                                    Summer 2012
In Alcate-Lucent, I finished a project related to IMS. I mainly designed a script tool
based on python to analyze users' information automatically. Also, I designed several 
script cases based on TCL language in order to achieve specific function on autocase 
platform.

BooBooke, Opensource Community                           Winter 2011
I designed several features in the first version of Boobooke player (opensource software 
hosted by github) using WTL framework. Also, I took charge in the development of test
tool.

<p>The precious experience from engineering intern do benefit me a lot. So if you have any recommendation for Research/Engineering Intern in ML/CV/DM, please do not hesitate to contact me <a href="mailto:bhan_phd@163.com">bhan_phd@163.com</a>.</p>
